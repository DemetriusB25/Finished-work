  <br>One of the reasons I love this game is because of the strategic element. My current rank is Silver 4. <br>My summoner name is Elm15. I currently play League of Legends everyday for about 2-3 hours.<br><br>Check out the League of Legends website. http://na.leagueoflegends.com

<p>CounterStrike:Global Offensive is my other main game I play and favor. This game is available on PC <br>and Ps4.
What I really like about the game is the strategic, exciting, and mechanical elements. I'd rate this game 5/5 stars.
My steam name is KKOBE. I play CounterStrike:Global Offensive everyday for about 4-5 hours.
